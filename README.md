about me guessing game

## LAB2

#### I build an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app

##### Reflections and Comments
##### first journal, submission questions, tools and resources used and learned
*it was really good ,To be honest I didn't expect it would take me more than two hours,but even it had taken 4 hours of thinking, trying , reading and getting help from the nice TAs; it was fun and i feel happy when i see my work* 
*for today, it was a little bit confusing because i added  code which combines loops with if statement at the same time, sometimes when i run the code i get a good results, but many times i don't get the same result even if i did't change the code and checked every single line to see if there are any mistakes. but it's fine, i'm sure i can handle it next times*
*and for lab4 which was first time of working with a partner, it was aÂ  bit better  we had a chance to exchange each other's experience and knowledge , also to motivate ourselves to learn more and try another way of thinking
